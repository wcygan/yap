Things you need to do...

- Hash the passwords lol
- Work on the Chat CLI
  - Add three screens:
    - Login (DONE)
    - Home (ask AI to clone it similar to the login page)
    - Chat (ask AI to integrate the example from https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/blob/master/examples/chat/main.go with your program)
  - Add page transitions according to the UI spec
  - Add a way to create a new user -- API Call
  - Add a way to login -- API Call
    - Store username & access token in CLI state (model?)
  - Add a way to create a new chat -- API Call
  - Add a way to connect to a chat -- API Call
  - Add a way to send and receive messages (grpc streaming) -- API Calls
  - Add a way to logout
- When a user logs in, have a random color assigned to their login information... Whenever they send a chat message, send the color too. This way, the chat messages will be colored according to the user.
- Work on creating chat-service
- Work on creating group-service
- Publish CLI binaries to GitHub / Add installation instructions
- Publish a Docker image of the CLI to Docker Hub
- Figure out how to use ingress for yap-api instead of port-forwarding
